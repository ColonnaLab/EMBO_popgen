# AlleleFreqDyn.txt - examines aspects of allele frequency changes under drift for

# ASSIGNMENT 1: For each of the sample data sets, try to devise a way to 
# estimate the population size N from the rate of increase in variance in 
# allele frequencies over generations.
# In the data sets, columns are distinct SNPs and rows are generations.

# ASSIGNMENT 2: It turns out that the sample data sets each have one SNP 
# that deviates from the neutral dynamics. Use whatever test you can 
# devise to determine which of the SNPs in the sample data sets appear to 
# depart from neutrality,
