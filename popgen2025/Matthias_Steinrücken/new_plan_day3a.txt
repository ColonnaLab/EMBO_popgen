===== Plan Day3a =====


Morning session: introduction to Bayesian methods

09:30-10:15 Lecture

- Present slides day3_bayes up to slide 77.
- Maybe a bit long, but maybe possible.
- Mention that notebooks (01_thinking, 02_concepts, 04_priors, 05_inference) same content, and more details

10:45-12:30 Practical session

(finish theory)
06_population.Rmd -- check
(03_genomics.Rmd, maybe for people that are quick) -- check
learning priors: practical_ABC.pdf Task 1 -- check







===== NOTES =====


Morning session: introduction to Bayesian methods

09:30-10:15 Lecture

either using slides in main.pdf or the jupyter notebooks:

01_thinking.ipynb
02_concepts.ipynb (straight to Normal/Normal model)
04_priors
05_inference

10:45-12:30 Practical session
(finish theory)
(03_genomics.ipynb)
06_population.ipynb
learning priors: practical_ABC.pdf Task 1



- probably I'll do a mixture?
- Slides and notebooks?
- Or maybe I can actually get everything into slides
- I think the notebooks are too long, so maybe slides help to keep it short

- Maybe fix slides for first lecture
- I think the way to go is to put the exercises on slides.


correspondence: slides -- notebook
=====
(slides numbers are pushed back a bit)
1 - 20: 01_thinking (slides are good)
21 - 32: 02_concepts (also a bit lacking, but maybe possible to save; also have some exercises)
33 - 58: 04_priors (bit sparse in beginning, but later maybe ok)
59 - 73: 05_inference (beginning a bit sparse, but then ok)
74 - 106: 07_computation (kinda ok, could maybe use more pictures)
107 - 128: 08_ABC (beginning ok, end a is clunky)




The nessy-example in 01_thinking is not good.
