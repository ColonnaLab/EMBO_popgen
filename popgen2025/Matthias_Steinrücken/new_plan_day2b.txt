===== Plan for Day2b =====

Afternoon session: introduction to coalescent theory

Day 2 13:30-14:15 Lecture

- 45 Minutes for up to slide 60 day2b.pdf.

- Say notebooks 04_coalescence, 05_subdivision, and 06_founder_effect have some details.


Day 2 14:45-16:30 Practical

You will attempt the exercises in day2b_practical.pdf for 1 hour.


Then I will go over:

exmaple_simple_one.py
example_AFR_EUR.py
example_simple_many.py

to show simple implementation of a simulation for a demographic model and calculation of some summary statistics using msprime.

Then you can either try to simulate the human models depicted in the figures or they can attempt to simulate a more realistic model of salmons, as provided (example_salmon.py).
- Either implement 3 epoch demography for humans,
- Or modify salmon exmaple to have more epochs (or different function).

We may leave the final 15 minutes for general Q&As.








===== NOTES =====

Afternoon session: introduction to coalescent theory

Day 2 13:30-14:15 Lecture

We will go over the first part of slides in Day2b.pdf, probably up to page 55 (labelled 115/135). 

- 45 Minutes for up to slide 60 day2b.pdf.

- Author notes (Day 2b) [slides refer to new version]:

Don't use these notebooks. Just show the plots [but say that notebook available]:
(- 15: notebook: coalescence)
(- 19: notebook: coalescence)
(- 55: notebook: coalescence)


Also just put figure in slides.
(- 77: notebook: subdivision) [this notebook fits better here]




Day 2 14:45-16:30 Practical

You will attempt the exercises in day2b_practical.pdf for 1 hour.


Then I will go over:

exmaple_simple_one.py
example_AFR_EUR.py
example_simple_many.py

to show simple implementation of a simulation for a demographic model and calculation of some summary statistics using msprime.


Then you can either try to simulate the human models depicted in the figures or they can attempt to simulate a more realistic model of salmons, as provided (example_salmon.py).
- both are only popsize changes.
- so at least do humans based on saloms


We may leave the final 15 minutes for general Q&As.






===== OLD PLAN =====


Afternoon session: introduction to coalescent theory

Day 2 13:30-14:15 Lecture

We will go over the first part of slides in Day2b.pdf, probably up to page 55 (labelled 115/135). 

Day 2 14:45-16:30 Practical

You will attempt the exercises in day2b_practical.pdf for 1 hour.

Afterwards we will go over a simple implementation of a simulation for a demographic model and calculation of some summary statistics using msprime (kindly provided by Cery Harman and Janeesh Bansal). 

There are two options. I will go through example.py and example-2.py to show the basics of msprime.

Then you can either try to simulate the human models depicted in the figures or they can attempt to simulate a more realistic model of salmons, as provided.
In practice, you will then be asked to use baseline codes to implement a different or more complex model and compare the new summary statistics.

We may leave the final 15 minutes for general Q&As.
