day 2:

-- stuff that goes with lecture is R
-- but then the practical is in python with msprime
-- maybe it is best to convert the R notebooks into python?
		-- perhaps that was actaully intended?
		-- it's a bit, but maybe best
		-- then again, RStudio is easier

R
RStudio


python
msprime
tqdm
demesdraw



==========

day 3:


- simulate in msprime, but abc package in R?
- heavy lifting on day 3 seems to be R?



python
tskit
csv
pymc3 (only for 08_MCMC, Matteo did not use)


R - library:
abc
coda
fields

I overlooked in 10_speciation:
`maps`
`spam`


10_speciation needs ms <-- we are definitely changing this to msprime




Overall:

R + RStudio (libraries: abc, coda, fields, maps, spam); Python (libraries: msprime, tskit, tqdm, demesdraw, csv, pymc3 <- should all be available via conda)


"ms" as well
