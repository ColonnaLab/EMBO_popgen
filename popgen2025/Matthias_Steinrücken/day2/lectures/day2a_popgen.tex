		\item The fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity, which carries information from one generation to the next one.
		\item A segment of DNA, composed of a transcribed region and regulatory sequences that make possible transcription and regulation.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Terminology}
	Let‚Äôs introduce some additional concepts that deal with how genetic variation can be summarized. These are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Allele}: A distinguishable and heritable quantity (SNP, indel, microsat).
		\item \textbf{Locus}: Any position (or unit) in the genome with one or more alleles.
		\item \textbf{Genotype}: Combination of alleles carried by an individual at a particular locus.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{block}{Example}
		An individual has \texttt{A} and \texttt{G} alleles, and therefore has \texttt{A/G} genotype, at locus in position 8,789,654 of chromosome 1.
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Locus}
	A \textbf{locus} (pl. \emph{loci}) can be defined as a generic position on a chromosome, or the position on a chromosome of a gene or other chromosome marker. Generally speaking, a locus is a location.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Allele}
	An \textbf{allele} is a variant of a gene or locus. Different alleles can lead to different phenotypes.\\[2ex]
	As we will see later, diploids have two copies of each gene. Therefore, we define as \emph{homozygote} an individual that possesses two copies of the same allele, while as \emph{heterozygote} if it possesses two different alleles.

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Diploids}
	What happens if you have multiple copies of each chromosome?\\[2ex]
	As \emph{diploid} species have two copies of their chromosomes, for a collection of $N$ diploid individuals, there are $2N$ gene copies at each locus, with one or more alleles.\\[2ex]
	As mutations are rare in most organisms, \textbf{bi-allelic} models are often used, with at most two alleles at each locus$^{*}$.\\[2ex]
	{\small $^{*}$E.g., at the red-hair vs. non-red-hair locus in \emph{MC1R}, most individuals have \texttt{C}, some have \texttt{T}, but \texttt{A} and \texttt{G} have not been observed suggesting a bi-allelic model is a valid approximation here.}

	Now that all the main terminology has been defined, we can have a closer look at the genetics of evolution.
	\begin{block}{What is evolutionary genetics?}
		In evolutionary genetics we are interested in studying the genetic \textbf{variation} between/within species/populations. It is both:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Retrospective}: Understanding what determined the current genetic composition of a species/population.
			\item \textbf{Predictive}: Predicting the future composition of a species/population from its current composition.

		\item Different alleles affect survival?

\visible<2>{$f_A(t)$ depends approximately on the product between $s$ (selection coefficient, or ``strength'') and t (time):\\[1ex]

	If $s > 0$ then $A$-bearing individuals have the advantage, the opposite is true for $s < 0$.}

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{graphics_day2a_popgen/dominant_blobs_arms.png}

	If the trait affected by $A$ has additive fitness then the heterozygote has a fitness value that is intermediate between the two homozygotes$^{*}$.\\[2ex]
	{\scriptsize $^{*}$You do not need to know any more than that. This enters an area called \emph{quantitative genetics} and there are entire courses on that topic.}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Types of selection}
	The types of selection just described can be defined as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Additive selection: $w_{AA} = 1$; $w_{Aa} = 1-s$; $w_{aa} = 1-2s$.
		\item Dominant advantageous allele: $w_{AA} = w_{Aa} > w_{aa}$.
		\item Recessive advantageous allele: $w_{AA} > w_{Aa} = w_{aa}$.
	\end{itemize}
	with $A$ being the advantageous allele.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	If the selection coefficient does not change over time, we have several possible scenarios:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Directional} selection (additive, dominant or recessive): One allele is favoured.
		\item \textbf{Heterozygote advantage}: Special case of balancing selection where multiple alleles are maintained in the population.
		\item \textbf{Heterozygote disadvantage}: Special case of disruptive selection where the extremes of a trait are favoured.
		\item \textbf{Stabilising selection}: Variation is reduced.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{graphics_day2a_popgen/polygenic_selection_models.png}

	{\footnotesize If the direction of selection changes over time, we have fluctuating selection.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Directional selection}
	$A$ is the advantageous allele if $w_{aa} \leq w_{Aa} \leq w_{AA}$.\\[2ex]
	$f_A$ will increase every generation and eventually reach 1 (i.e.\ \textbf{fixation} of $A$ and \textbf{loss} of $a$).\\[2ex]
	The rate of change in allele frequency depends on $s$, the selection coefficient.\\
	Even small $s$ can change allele frequency substantially over many generations.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Heterozygote advantage}
	If $w_{Aa} > w_{AA}, w_{aa}$ we define
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\tfrac{w_{aa}}{w_{Aa}} & = 1 - s_{aa}\\
			\tfrac{w_{AA}}{w_{Aa}} & = 1 - s_{AA}
		\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	$f_A$ will tend to the same intermediate value regardless of its initial frequency. In fact, selection will not eliminate either allele (it is a special case of \textbf{balancing selection}).
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Heterozygote disadvantage}
	If $w_{Aa} < w_{AA}, w_{aa}$, it results in the fixation of one of the two alleles (which one?).\\[2ex]
	It is an example of \textbf{disruptive selection} that removes low-minor-frequency alleles.
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	We have learnt how \textbf{selection} changes allele frequencies in time. You also know how \textbf{genetic drift} changes allele frequencies in time.
	\begin{block}{}
		What is the combined effect of selection and drift?
	\end{block}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	For a population of size $N$, the fixation probability $u$ of a new mutation with selection coefficient $s$ can be defined as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Strongly deleterious: If $2Ns << -1$ then $u \approx 0$.
		\item Nearly neutral deleterious: If $-1 < 2Ns < 1$ then $u \approx 1/(2N)$.
		\item Strongly advantageous: If $2Ns >> 1$ then $u \approx 2s$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
	\begin{block}{}
		Strongly advantageous mutations are not necessarily fixed. Slightly deleterious alleles have a small but non-zero chance of being fixed.
	\end{block}
	\vspace{2ex}
	\begin{block}{}
		Whether an allele is strongly selected or nearly neutral depends on both the selection coefficient and the population size.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}\frametitle{Mutations}
	New mutations arise to produce new genetic variation that genetic drift can act on:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deletions
		\item Insertions
		\item Translocations
		\item Point mutations
	\end{itemize}
	Any of these mutations can be represented with a bi-allelic model (e.g. presence/absence) if we assume that multiple mutations cannot occur in the same location$^{*}$.\\[2ex]
	{\footnotesize $^{*}$This assumption is also called the \emph{infinite} site model.}
