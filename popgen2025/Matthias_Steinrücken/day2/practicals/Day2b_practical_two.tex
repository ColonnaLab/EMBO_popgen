% Create the part-within-a-problem counter, "within" the problem counter.

% is incremented.

% Specify that parts should be labeled with lowercase letters.
\renewcommand{\thepartnum}{\alph{partnum}}

% Make a counter to keep track of total points assigned to problems...
\newcounter{totalpoints}

% Make counters to keep track of points for parts...
\newcounter{curprobpts}		% Points assigned for the problem as a whole.
\newcounter{totalparts}		% Total points assigned to the various parts.

% Make a counter to keep track of the number of points on each page...
\newcounter{pagepoints}
% This counter is reset each time a page is printed.

% This "program" keeps track of how many points appear on each page, so that
% the total can be printed on the page itself.  Points are added to the total
% for a page when the PART (not the problem) they are assigned to is specified.
% When a problem without parts appears, the PAGEPOINTS are incremented directly
% from the problem as a whole (CURPROBPTS).

% problem.  If no parts appeared (or if they were all assigned zero points,
% then it increments TOTALPOINTS directly from CURPROBPTS, the points assigned
% to the last problem as a whole.  If the last problem did contain parts, it
% checks to make sure that their point values total up to the correct sum.
% It then puts the problem number on the page, along with the points assigned
% to it.

EBMO 2025 -- Population Genomics\\

Day 2 -- afternoon -- Practical \# 2\\


We will explore the files:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{example\_simple\_one.py}
	\item \texttt{example\_simple\_many.py}
	\item \texttt{example\_AFR\_EUR.py}
\end{itemize}
together to see some examples how the library \texttt{msprime} in \texttt{Python} can be used for genomic simulations of different demographic scenarios.\\

Extend these examples to solve one of the following problems. The material at\\
\url{https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/stable/demography.html} or\\
\url{https://tskit.dev/tutorials/popgen.html} should help you to find the relevant commands.

% problem
\begin{problem}{-1}
Implement simulations for one of the three models of population size changes for humans (European, Asian, African-American) described in the following figures. (The models with three epochs of constant population size: $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$.) Simulate several datasets of 100kb for a sample of 20 individuals. Compute \textbf{diversity}, \textbf{Tajima's D}, and the \textbf{Site Frequency Spectrum} (allele frequency spectrum) for each simulated datasets, and visualize these values across datasets.\\

Here is the model:\\

% problem
\begin{problem}{-1}
Implement simulations for the population size history of \emph{Atlantic Salmon} given in the following figure. You can approximate the size history by a piece-wise constant function with 3 pieces (but you can make the approximation more precise later). Assume that one generation is equal to six years. Simulate several datasets of 100kb for a sample of size 20 individuals. Compute \textbf{diversity}, \textbf{Tajima's D}, and the \textbf{Site Frequency Spectrum} (allele frequency spectrum) for each simulated datasets, and visualize these values across datasets.\\
