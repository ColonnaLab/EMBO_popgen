# Given count of SNPs, estimate theta (Watterson)

# ASSIGNMENT 1: Suppose you observe 52 SNPs in a sample of 100 individuals.  
# Use the Infinite Sites model to estimate theta (this is known as the 
# Watterson estimator of theta). What if there were 26 SNPs instead of 52?   
# What if the sample size was 50 instead of 100?



# ASSIGNMENT 2: See if you can show that the expected number of singletons 
# depends only on theta and (amazingly) NOT on the sample size.
