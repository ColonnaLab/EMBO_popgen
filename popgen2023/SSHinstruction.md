##  SSH
For this course we will work on the High Performance Cluster of the [Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare](https://www.ba.infn.it/index.php/en/)

The filesystem has been generated according to this structure

<img src="./img/recas_infrastructure.png" alt="yay" height="500" width="400">

Each has writing permission only in the folder(s) with their name and reading permission to any folder.


To connect to the INFN machine using SSH from a Linux terminal use:

```
ssh -Y yourusername@embo-popgen.recas.ba.infn.it
```
the -Y tag enable graphical options

Username and password were given to you at the reception
