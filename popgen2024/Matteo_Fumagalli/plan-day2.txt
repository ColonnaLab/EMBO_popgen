Plan for Day2

Morning session: introduction to population genetics

Day 2 09:30-10:15 Lecture
Day 2 10:45-12:30 Practical session

This will be a mix of lecture and individual experiments. We will use the slides Day2a.pdf and the relevant notebooks.
We will cover terminology, alleles and genotypes, drift and fitness.

Afternoon session: introduction to coalescent theory

Day 2 13:30-14:15 Lecture

We will go over the first part of slides in Day2b.pdf, probably up to page 55 (labelled 115/135). 

Day 2 14:45-16:30 Practical

You will attempt the exercises in day2b_practical.pdf for 1 hour.

Afterwards we will go over a simple implementation of a simulation for a demographic model and calculation of some summary statistics using msprime (kindly provided by Cery Harman and Janeesh Bansal). 

There are two options. I will go through example.py and example-2.py to show the basics of msprime.

Then you can either try to simulate the human models depicted in the figures or they can attempt to simulate a more realistic model of salmons, as provided.
In practice, you will then be asked to use baseline codes to implement a different or more complex model and compare the new summary statistics.

We may leave the final 15 minutes for general Q&As.
